## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version `(0.1.1)` I have:

* Updated the `DESCRIPTION` to specify `R (>= 4.1)` for native pipe usage (@bbolker, #1).
* Updated the URL in `NEWS.md` from the previous version (`0.1.0`) to its canonical form.
* Updated `CITATION` to use `bibentry()` instead of `citEntry()`.
