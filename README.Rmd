An R Package to compute Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC), Situational Clustering Tests, and Main Effects

## Overview

This package contains a set of functions to conduct Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC) (Miethe, Hart & Regoeczi, 2008), to identify and quantify situational clustering in dominant case configurations (Hart, 2019), and to determine the main effects of specific variable values on the probabilities of outcome (Hart, Rennison & Miethe, 2017). Initially conceived as an exploratory technique for multivariate analysis of categorical data, CACC has developed to include formal statistical tests that can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. This technique allows examining composite profiles of different units of analysis in an alternative way to variable-oriented methods.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cacc from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install}
#| eval: false

# Check if the`devtools` package needs to be installed
if (!require("devtools")) install.package("devtools")

# Install the {cacc} package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("amoneva/cacc")
```

## Examples

```{r load}
#| warning: false

# Load {cacc} and the {tidyverse}
library(cacc)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r explore}
# Explore the dataset
onharassment |> glimpse()
```

### CACC

```{r cacc}
# Calculate the CACC matrix
cacc_matrix <- onharassment |> 
  cacc(
    ivs = sex:privacy, 
    dv = rep_victim
  )

# Look at the first few rows
cacc_matrix |> head()
```

### Situational Clustering Tests

```{r chi}
# Compute a Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test
cacc_matrix |> cluster_xsq()
```

```{r sci}
# Compute a Situational Clustering Index (SCI)
cacc_matrix |> cluster_sci()

# Plot a Lorenz Curve to visualize the SCI
cacc_matrix |> plot_sci()
```

### Main Effects

```{r effect}
# Compute the main effects for a specific variable value
cacc_matrix |> 
  main_effect(
    iv = sex,
    value = "female",
    # Set to `FALSE` for a numeric vector of effects
    summary = TRUE
  )

# Plot the distribution of the main effect
cacc_matrix |> 
  plot_effect(
    iv = sex,
    value = "female"
  )
```
